Ansible Playbook - ZeroMQ
=========================

This Ansible playbook installs **ZeroMQ** and all of its dependancies along with its **Python** binding: **pyzmq**.

These are the files (ZeroMQ and its dependancies) it fetches and installs:
	
* ZeroMQ
* autoconf
* automake
* build-essential
* libtool
* uuid-dev
* *python-pip*
* *python-dev*
* *pyzmq*

It's that simple.
