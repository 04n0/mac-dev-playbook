* Look into using Jinja2 to adhere with DRY principles. If an app comes in a tar archive, have a workflow for extracting apps from those archives, same thing if it comes in a dmg, or a zip.
* Look into the ability to change directories for multiple commands as upposed to having to change directories on each command.
* Ensure generalization of playbooks and assist distribution by replacing hosts and usernames with code that will allow them to be set on run time.
